# ENDG 310 - Lab #2

This README.md file should be populated prior to final submission and should include your name (as the author), a description of the lab, some discussion of the results, and should **show** your final infographic.  For example, here is image from the NRCan data:

This README contains the results from my ENDG 310 lab#2. In this lab, I analyzed CO2 data gotten from the Mauna Loa Observatory, as well as Wildfire data. In order to analyze the data with Python, I converted the data to a DataFrame, using the pandas library. Analyzing the data involved reading the data values into the python program, visualising the data using Python tools such as mathplotlib, and finding any meaningful connections between the data. By plotting the different data sets, this task was made easier, as it aided in seeing any common trends between the data sets. The deliverable of the lab is to create an infographic that helps convey a message relating the two sets of data used. On analyzing the Co2 and wildfire data, the conclusion was that the increase in CO2 in the atmosphere is correlated with the increase in the intensity and number of wildfires recorded. On analyzing the CO2 data, as well as the wildfire data, and computing the annual increases over multiple years, it was clear that with an high increase in CO2 levels in a year, there were also proportional increases in the wildfires. While these two parameters are closely related, it is inaccurate to conclude that one causes the other.
This is the image of my infographic:
